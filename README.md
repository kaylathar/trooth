## Trooth

Trooth is a generic math library I am developing.  Currently, it has basic big integer support that is primitive in nature.  Plans are listed below, however from a large prospective, think of it as a self-contained, only pay for what you use, large number, numerical analysis, and symbolic algebra library.

### Planned Features

* Full big integer support
* Full arbitrary sized fixed point support
* Root finding support
* Interpolation
* Symbolic algebra
* Differentiation
* Integration
* Linear algebra
* Basic statistical analaysis functionality
* Ruby/C/C++ APIs available
