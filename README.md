## Trooth

Trooth is a toy generic math library I am developing.  Currently, it has basic big integer support that is primitive in nature.  Plans are listed below, however from a large prospective, think of it as a self-contained, only pay for what you use, large number, numerical analysis, and symbolic algebra library.

### Planned Features

* Full big integer support
* Full arbitrary sized fixed point support
* Root finding support
* Interpolation
* Symbolic algebra
* Differentiation
* Integration
* Linear algebra
* Basic statistical analaysis functionality
* Ruby/C/C++ APIs available

Goal of library is primarily to have fun and play with implementing these sorts of algorithms and data structures, eventually optimizing and refactoring. It is not recommended to use this library for anything important.
